Fraud Risk Policy Framework

A merchant is considered elevated fraud risk if one or more of the following conditions apply:

- Refund ratio exceeds 30% of total transactions.
- Chargeback rate exceeds 2%.
- Sudden spikes in transaction volume occur within short timeframes.
- High concentration of large transactions above 10,000 currency units.
- Transactions originate from high-risk geographic regions.

High fraud risk merchants require enhanced monitoring and potential account review.
