Transaction Risk Scoring Model (Conceptual)

Transaction risk increases when:

- Transaction amount exceeds 10,000.
- Multiple high-value transactions occur within short time periods.
- Transactions are inconsistent with historical merchant behavior.
- Unusual time-of-day patterns appear.

Risk scoring combines:
- Amount deviation
- Frequency anomaly
- Behavioral consistency
- Refund and chargeback signals
