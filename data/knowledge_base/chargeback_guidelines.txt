Chargeback Monitoring Guidelines

A chargeback occurs when a customer disputes a transaction with their issuing bank.

Industry standards indicate:
- A chargeback rate above 1% is considered elevated.
- A chargeback rate above 2% may lead to payment network monitoring programs.

High chargeback rates may indicate:
- Fraudulent activity
- Poor customer service
- Product quality issues
- Misleading business practices

Merchants exceeding thresholds may face penalties or account restrictions.
