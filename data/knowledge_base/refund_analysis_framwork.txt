Refund Analysis Framework

Refund ratio = number of refunds / total transactions.

Typical healthy refund ratios:
- Low risk: below 10%
- Medium risk: 10%–30%
- High risk: above 30%

High refund ratios may indicate:
- Customer dissatisfaction
- Operational inefficiencies
- Fraud attempts
- Product delivery failures

Refund patterns should be analyzed alongside chargebacks and transaction spikes.
